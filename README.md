# Welcome to the "AI Comedy Club" Challenge

You are about to step into our virtual comedy club, but there's a twist - the stage is open only for AI performers! In this challenge, your task is to develop a unique AI performer (a chatbot), who can not only tell jokes but also appreciates humor by rating jokes told by its fellow AI comedians.

## Join the AI Comedy Club

Contribute to the AI Comedy Club and be part of a community that believes in the joy of laughter and the power of AI. We look forward to seeing your contributions - and laughing at your jokes!

So come on in, let's code, let's laugh, and let's make the AI Comedy Club the funniest place in the world of AI!

## Rules of the AI Comedy Club

1. Your AI comedian should be a good sport, capable of rating other performers' jokes on a scale from 1 (not funny) to 
10 (hilarious).

2. Creativity is key. We want a performer, not a monotonous joke-telling machine. Your bot should have some level of interactivity, asking the user about their mood, their preference for joke types, and so on.

3. Remember, this is a friendly club, so keep all jokes appropriate and safe for work.

## How to Get on Stage


To perform at the AI Comedy Club, you need to prepare your act. Here's the step-by-step process:

1.  Fork this repository: Create your personal copy of the AI Comedy Club repository.

2.  Create your stage: In the `bots` directory of the forked repository, create a new directory. The name of this directory should be your username or your bot's name. Remember to keep it free of spaces or special characters. For example, if your name is John Doe, your directory will be `bots/johndoe/`.

3.  Prepare your script: In your new directory, create a Python file named `joke_bot.py`. This file will contain the code for your bot's functionality. Specifically, it must define a `Bot` class with two methods:

    -   `tell_joke()`: This method should generate and return a string containing a joke.
    -   `rate_joke(joke: str)`: This method should take a string (representing the joke to be rated) and return an integer from 1 to 10, which represents the rating of the joke.
4.  Test your bot: In the same directory, write a `test_joke_bot.py` file using pytest to test your bot's functionalities. Your bot must pass all tests to be allowed on stage. The test file should cover tests for both `tell_joke` and `rate_joke` methods.

5.  Get on stage: Once you've tested your bot and everything works fine, commit your changes and create a pull request. After a review, if all tests pass, your bot will be allowed to perform on the AI Comedy Club stage!

Remember: Only bots that have passed all tests will be allowed to perform. We value the quality of the performance and want to make sure all jokes told on stage are top-notch. Happy coding and joking!
## Scoring and Applause

Your AI comedian should be able to use diverse methods to judge other comedians.

-   Humor: How funny are the jokes your AI comedian tells?
-   Relevance: How well does your bot respond to the user's input?
-   Creativity: How unique and varied are your bot's responses?
-   Interactivity: How well does your bot engage the user in conversation?
-   Joke Rating Accuracy: How well does your bot rate the humor of a joke?
-   Script Quality: Is your code clean, efficient, and adhering to best practices?
-   Script Clarity: Have you provided clear and comprehensive documentation for your code and decision-making process?

After your bot is ready for the limelight, submit a pull request to the main repository. The GitHub CI/CD pipeline will then bring your bot on stage to perform against the other AI comedians in the repository.

Disclaimer: As humor can be subjective, the humor aspect of the scoring will be evaluated based on a predefined set of jokes and their anticipated humor level. Our virtual audience (judges) are eagerly waiting to be entertained!

Best of luck, and let's get the laughter rolling!
